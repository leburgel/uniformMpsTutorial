    "### 1.4 Algorithms for finding canonical forms\n",
    "The success of using MPS for describing physical systems stems from the fact that they provide efficient approximations to a large class of physically relevant states. In one dimension, they have been shown to approximate low-energy states of gapped systems arbitrarily well at only a polynomial cost in the bond dimension $D$. This means that in principle we can push MPS results for these systems to arbitrary precision as long as we increase the bond dimension enough. However, increasing the bond dimension comes at a numerical cost, as the complexity of any MPS algorithm scales with $D$. As opposed to the naive routines given above, it is possible to ensure that the complexity of all MPS algorithms scales as $O(D^3)$, so long as we are a bit careful when implementing them.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first example, we can refrain from explicitly contructing the matrices that are used in the eigenvalue problems, and instead pass a function that implements the action of the corresponding operator on a vector to the eigenvalue solver. We demonstrate this for the problem of normalizing an MPS, where instead of explicitly constructing the transfer matrix we now define a function handle which implements its action on the right and left fixed points using an optimal contraction sequence:"

    "We can similarly improve both the efficiency and accuracy of the routines bringing a given MPS into its mixed canonical form. While plugging in the more efficient ways of finding the left and right fixed point into the above `mixedCanonical` routine would reduce its complexity to $O(D^3)$, this algorithm would still be suboptimal in terms of numerical accuracy. This arises from the fact that, while $l$ and $r$ are theoretically known to be positive hermitian matrices, at least one of them will nevertheless have small eigenvalues, say of order $\\eta$, if the MPS is supposed to provide a good approximation to an actual state. In practice, $l$ and $r$ are determined using an iterative eigensolver and will only be accurate up to a specified tolerance $\\epsilon$. Upon taking the 'square roots' $L$ and $R$, the numerical precision will then decrease to $\\text{min}(\\sqrt{\\epsilon}, \\epsilon/\\sqrt{\\eta})$. Furthermore, gauge transforming $A$ with $L$ or $R$ requires the potentially ill-conditioned inversions of $L$ and $R$, and will typically yield $A_L$ and $A_R$ which violate the orthonormalization condition in the same order $\\epsilon/\\sqrt{\\eta}$. We can circumvent both these probelems by resorting to so-called *single-layer algorithms*. These are algorithms that only work on the level of the MPS tensors in the ket layer, and never consider operations for which contractions with the bra layer are needed. We now demonstrate such a single-layer algorithm for finding canonical forms.\n",
